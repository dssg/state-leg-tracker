In any class action governed exclusively 6 by Alabama law, any order of a circuit court entering a full 7 and final judgment pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. p. 54 as to all 8 claims and issues, whether by settlement or other 9 adjudication, that results in the creation of a common fund 10 for the benefit of the class, shall establish a specific plan 11 for the distribution of any residual funds, under which any 12 funds remaining after payment of all benefits to or for the 13 benefit of class members shall be paid to the Department of 14 Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention. 15 Section 2. For the purpose of this act, residual 16 funds from a class action common fund are those funds that 17 remain undistributed due to circumstances in which the members 18 of the class cannot be located, funds for which the direct 19 distribution to individual class members is not economically 20 feasible, funds which remain after all class members are given 21 a full opportunity to make a claim, or funds payable to or 22 otherwise for the benefit of class members which for any 23 reason remain undistributed after the time period established 24 by the circuit court presiding over the action. All residual 25 funds shall be distributed to the Department of Child Abuse 26 and Neglect Prevention consistent with a specific plan as 27 provided in Section 1. Page 2 1 Section 3. Nothing in this act is intended to be nor 2 shall be construed so as to limit the rights of parties to a 3 class action to contract in settlement for the reversion of 4 residual funds to the paying party or to one or more persons 5 or entities designated by the circuit court or a class member 6 as a beneficiary or assignee of the rights of a class member. 7 Section 4. Notwithstanding the obligations imposed 8 by Section 1, in the event the circuit court presiding over a 9 class action finds that, except with regard to the obligations 10 imposed by Section 1, parties to a class action have reached a 11 settlement on behalf of or for the benefit of class member, 12 the circuit court may intervene and attempt to assist the 13 parties' efforts in reaching a resolution or settlement of the 14 class action. In the event the circuit court undertakes to 15 perform duties under this section, the circuit court, in its 16 discretion, and upon determination by the circuit court that 17 the obligations imposed by Section 1 are a substantial 18 impediment to settlement, may suspend the requirements of 19 Section 1. 20 Section 5. This act shall apply to all cases filed 21 on or after January 1, 2015. 22 Section 6. This act shall become effective 23 immediately following its passage and approval by the 24 Governor, or its otherwise becoming law. Page 3\"\n",
