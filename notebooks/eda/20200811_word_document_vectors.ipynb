       "'BILL NUMBER: SB 1136\\tINTRODUCED\\n\\tBILL TEXT\\nINTRODUCED BY   Senators Huff and Mitchell\\n                        FEBRUARY 20, 2014\\n   An act to amend Sections 1522 and 1522.08 of the Health and Safety\\nCode, to amend Section 11105 of the Penal Code, and to amend Section\\n16504.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to foster\\ncare.\\n\\tLEGISLATIVE COUNSEL\\'S DIGEST\\n   SB 1136, as introduced, Huff. Foster care providers: criminal\\nrecords.\\n    Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to\\nlicense and regulate community care facilities, including foster\\nfamily homes, certified family homes of licensed foster family\\nagencies, and group homes. Existing law requires that persons\\nproviding care or services at these homes or facilities obtain either\\na criminal record clearance or an exemption from disqualification\\nfrom the department, as prescribed.\\n   Existing law authorizes a child welfare agency to secure from an\\nappropriate governmental criminal justice agency the state summary\\ncriminal history information for specified purposes, including an\\nassessment of the appropriateness of placing a child subject to the\\njurisdiction of the juvenile court with a relative or nonrelative\\nextended family member.\\n   This bill would authorize the State Department of Social Services\\nto share all information related to a criminal record clearance or\\nexemption granted by the department with a county child welfare\\nagency with responsibility to monitor the health and safety of\\npersons receiving care, treatment, or services from state licensed\\nfoster homes, certified homes of licensed foster family agencies and\\nemployees of those agencies, and licensed group homes. The bill would\\nfurther authorize a county child welfare agency to receive\\nstate-summary criminal history information for purposes of assessing\\nthe appropriateness and safety of placing a child who has been\\ndetained or is a dependent of the court in a licensed foster family\\nhome, group home, or state-licensed foster home, and monitoring the\\nhealth and safety of persons in those placements.\\n   Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes.\\nState-mandated local program: no.\\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:\\n  SECTION 1.  Section 1522 of the Health and Safety Code is amended\\nto read:\\n   1522.  The Legislature recognizes the need to generate timely and\\naccurate positive fingerprint identification of applicants as a\\ncondition of issuing licenses, permits, or certificates of approval\\nfor persons to operate or provide direct care services in a community\\ncare facility, foster family home, or a certified family home of a\\nlicensed foster family agency.  The Legislature also recognizes\\nthe need for sharing of information between the State Department of\\nSocial Services and county child welfare agencies in order to protect\\nthe health and safety of persons receiving care, treatment, or\\nservices from individuals or facilities licensed or certified by the\\nstate.  Therefore, the Legislature supports the use of the\\nfingerprint live-scan technology, as identified in the long-range\\nplan of the Department of Justice for fully automating the processing\\nof fingerprints and other data by the year 1999, otherwise known as\\nthe California Crime Information Intelligence System (CAL-CII), to be\\nused for applicant fingerprints. It is the intent of the Legislature\\nin enacting this section to require the fingerprints of those\\nindividuals whose contact with community care clients may pose a risk\\nto the clients\\' health and safety. An individual shall be required\\nto obtain either a criminal record clearance or a criminal record\\nexemption from the State Department of Social Services before his or\\nher initial presence in a community care facility.\\n   (a) (1) Before issuing a license or special permit to any person\\nor persons to operate or manage a community care facility, the State\\nDepartment of Social Services shall secure from an appropriate law\\nenforcement agency a criminal record to determine whether the\\napplicant or any other person specified in subdivision (b) has ever\\nbeen convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation or\\narrested for any crime specified in Section 290 of the Penal Code,\\nfor violating Section 245 or 273.5, of the Penal Code, subdivision\\n(b) of Section 273a of the Penal Code, or, prior to January 1, 1994,\\nparagraph (2) of Section 273a of the Penal Code, or for any crime for\\nwhich the department cannot grant an exemption if the person was\\nconvicted and the person has not been exonerated.\\n   (2) The criminal history information shall include the full\\ncriminal record, if any, of those persons, and subsequent arrest\\ninformation pursuant to Section 11105.2 of the Penal Code.\\n   (3) Except during the 2003-04 to the 2014-15 fiscal years,\\ninclusive, neither the Department of Justice nor the State Department\\nof Social Services may charge a fee for the fingerprinting of an\\napplicant for a license or special permit to operate a facility\\nproviding nonmedical board, room, and care for six or less children\\nor for obtaining a criminal record of the applicant pursuant to this\\nsection.\\n   (4) The following shall apply to the criminal record information:\\n   (A) If the State Department of Social Services finds that the\\napplicant, or any other person specified in subdivision (b), has been\\nconvicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation, the\\napplication shall be denied, unless the director grants an exemption\\npursuant to subdivision (g).\\n   (B) If the State Department of Social Services finds that the\\napplicant, or any other person specified in subdivision (b) is\\nawaiting trial for a crime other than a minor traffic violation, the\\nState Department of Social Services may cease processing the\\napplication until the conclusion of the trial.\\n   (C) If no criminal record information has been recorded, the\\nDepartment of Justice shall provide the applicant and the State\\nDepartment of Social Services with a statement of that fact.\\n   (D) If the State Department of Social Services finds after\\nlicensure that the licensee, or any other person specified in\\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b), has been convicted of a crime other\\nthan a minor traffic violation, the license may be revoked, unless\\nthe director grants an exemption pursuant to subdivision (g).\\n   (E) An applicant and any other person specified in subdivision (b)\\nshall submit fingerprint images and related information to the\\nDepartment of Justice for the purpose of searching the criminal\\nrecords of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in addition to the\\ncriminal records search required by this subdivision. If an applicant\\nand all other persons described in subdivision (b) meet all of the\\nconditions for licensure, except receipt of the Federal Bureau of\\nInvestigation\\'s criminal offender record information search response\\nfor the applicant or any of the persons described in subdivision (b),\\nthe department may issue a license if the applicant and each person\\ndescribed in subdivision (b) has signed and submitted a statement\\nthat he or she has never been convicted of a crime in the United\\nStates, other than a traffic infraction, as prescribed in paragraph\\n(1) of subdivision (a) of Section 42001 of the Vehicle Code. If,\\nafter licensure, the department determines that the licensee or any\\nother person specified in subdivision (b) has a criminal record, the\\nlicense may be revoked pursuant to Section 1550. The department may\\nalso suspend the license pending an administrative hearing pursuant\\nto Section 1550.5.\\n   (F) The State Department of Social Services shall develop\\nprocedures to provide the individual\\'s state and federal criminal\\nhistory information with the written notification of his or her\\nexemption denial or revocation based on the criminal record. Receipt\\nof the criminal history information shall be optional on the part of\\nthe individual, as set forth in the agency\\'s procedures. The\\nprocedure shall protect the confidentiality and privacy of the\\nindividual\\'s record, and the criminal history information shall not\\nbe made available to the employer.\\n   (G) Notwithstanding any other law, the department is authorized to\\nprovide an individual with a copy of his or her state or federal\\nlevel criminal offender record information search response as\\nprovided to that department by the Department of Justice if the\\ndepartment has denied a criminal background clearance based on this\\ninformation and the individual makes a written request to the\\ndepartment for a copy specifying an address to which it is to be\\nsent. The state or federal level criminal offender record information\\nsearch response shall not be modified or altered from its form or\\ncontent as provided by the Department of Justice and shall be\\nprovided to the address specified by the individual in his or her\\nwritten request. The department shall retain a copy of the individual\\'\\ns written request and the response and date provided.\\n   (b) (1) In addition to the applicant, this section shall be\\napplicable to criminal convictions of the following persons:\\n   (A) Adults responsible for administration or direct supervision of\\nstaff.\\n   (B) Any person, other than a client, residing in the facility.\\n   (C) Any person who provides client assistance in dressing,\\ngrooming, bathing, or personal hygiene.

A certified nurse assistant and\\ncertified home health aide who will be providing client assistance\\nand who falls under this exemption shall provide one copy of his or\\nher current certification, prior to providing care, to the community\\ncare facility. The facility shall maintain the copy of the\\ncertification on file as long as care is being provided by the\\ncertified nurse assistant or certified home health aide at the\\nfacility. Nothing in this paragraph restricts the right of the\\ndepartment to exclude a certified nurse assistant or certified home\\nhealth aide from a licensed community care facility pursuant to\\nSection 1558.\\n   (D) Any staff person, volunteer, or employee who has contact with\\nthe clients.\\n   (E) If the applicant is a firm, partnership, association, or\\ncorporation, the chief executive officer or other person serving in\\nlike capacity.\\n   (F) Additional officers of the governing body of the applicant, or\\nother persons with a financial interest in the applicant, as\\ndetermined necessary by the department by regulation.
